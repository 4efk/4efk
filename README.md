Hey!, i'm 4efk (as my profile name says) 
I'm learning programming and i do mostly GameDev now, so i'm also trying to get better at my music and art skills
I don't post here often, because my code is terrible and nobody cares about it anyway
I was doing stuff in Python a lot, but now i'm using GDScript in the Godot engine
