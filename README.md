Hey! I'm 4efk.
I'm learning programming and i mostly do gamedev now, so i'm also trying to get better at my music and art skills.
I don't post here often, mostly because I just see no reason to do so, but maybe you will find something interesting here.
I was doing stuff in Python a lot, dipped my toes in web design and JavaScript and now i'm mostly using GDScript in the Godot engine.
